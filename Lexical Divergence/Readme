📘 Lexical Divergence Evaluation (Sentence-Level, Domain-Aware)
This repository provides a pipeline to evaluate lexical divergence in machine-translated (MT) texts, with a focus on domain-specific terminology—particularly terms related to politics, peacekeeping, and conflict. The method identifies how well these critical keywords are preserved, replaced, or omitted during translation.

The analysis is conducted at the sentence level, assessing whether domain-relevant terms are retained or substituted with semantically similar alternatives.

🚀 Project Structure
The project is organized by language pairs and MT systems:

Each subfolder includes a sentence_pairs.csv file containing original and machine-translated sentence pairs.

🧩 Functionality Overview
The main script performs the following steps:

Loads sentence pairs (Original vs. MT).

Identifies missing or altered domain terms using a reference lexicon (e.g., conflict or political terminology).

For each missing term:

Computes the closest semantic match in the MT sentence using ConfliBERT embeddings.

Assigns a score:

Lexical_Score = 0.7 × CosineSimilarity + 0.3 × ConflictLexiconMatch
Classifies each sentence as:

Acceptable

Divergence

Using:

A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based threshold

A static threshold (default = 0.60)

Generates outputs, including:

📊 Lexical score distributions

📦 Summary statistics

📌 Top reasons for divergence

🧾 Input Format
Each sentence_pairs.csv must contain:

Original_EN	MT_EN
The ceasefire was violated...	The truce was broken...
Protesters gathered downtown...	Demonstrations erupted...

A domain-specific lexicon should be located at:

conflict_lexicon.csv:

term
ceasefire
protest
intervention

🧾 Output Files
The following files are generated in /output_lexical_gmm/ and /output_lexical_static/:

lexical_divergence_results.csv – Final classification results

missing_terms_lexical.csv – Terms not found in MT outputs

candidates_lexical.csv – Semantic match candidates and scores

lexical_divergence_summary.csv – Aggregated metrics

This project uses the pretrained model:

eventdata-utd/ConfliBERT-scr-uncased
(via Hugging Face) – specialized for political/conflict domain semantics.

🧪 How to Run
Open Lexical_DivergenceV4.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Run all cells in sequence.

Ensure the following files are present in your working directory:

sentence_pairs.csv

conflict_lexicon.csv

Output directories (e.g., /output_lexical_gmm/, /output_lexical_static/) will be created automatically.
