# Sentence-Level Lexical Divergence Evaluation

This repository contains a robust implementation of a sentence-level evaluation metric designed to measure **lexical divergence in machine-translated texts**, particularly for political and humanitarian domains. It complements traditional MT metrics (e.g., BLEU, METEOR, BERTScore) by identifying whether **domain-critical terms** were preserved, omitted, or semantically drifted.

Each subfolder includes a `sentence_pairs.csv` file containing original and machine-translated sentence pairs.

## 🧩 Functionality Overview

The main script performs the following steps:

1. **Loads sentence pairs** (Original vs. MT).
2. **Identifies missing or altered domain terms** using a reference lexicon (e.g., conflict or political terminology).
3. For each missing term:
   - Computes the **closest semantic match** in the MT sentence using `ConfliBERT` embeddings.
   - Assigns a score:

     ```
     Lexical_Score = 0.7 × CosineSimilarity + 0.3 × ConflictLexiconMatch
     ```

4. **Classifies** each sentence as:
   - `Acceptable`
   - `Divergence`

   Using:
   - A **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)**-based threshold
   - A **static threshold** (default = 0.60)

5. **Generates outputs**, including:
   - 📊 Lexical score distributions
   - 📦 Summary statistics
   - 📌 Top reasons for divergence

## 🧾 Input Format

Each `sentence_pairs.csv` must contain:

| Original_EN                     | MT_EN                            |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| The ceasefire was violated...  | The truce was broken...          |
| Protesters gathered downtown...| Demonstrations erupted...        |

A domain-specific lexicon should be located at:

**`conflict_lexicon.csv`**:

| term        |
|-------------|
| ceasefire   |
| protest     |
| intervention|
