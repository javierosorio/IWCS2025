# ðŸ“˜ Lexical Divergence Evaluation (Sentence-Level, Domain-Aware)

This repository provides a pipeline to evaluate **lexical divergence** in **machine-translated (MT) texts**, with a focus on **domain-specific terminology**â€”particularly terms related to politics, peacekeeping, and conflict. The method identifies how well these critical keywords are preserved, replaced, or omitted during translation.

The analysis is conducted at the **sentence level**, assessing whether domain-relevant terms are retained or substituted with semantically similar alternatives.
